# Recipee-Advisor
Food AI is designed to solve the problem of people, which did not know much about Pakistani dishes they in a hurry and they try to make local food by
themselves in a few minutes and if they know about the dish, but forget their names so they easily find the name by using our application we build this
application by keep in mind that particular audience.

In this modern era where website’s , applications and blogs have a great impact on human’s but somehow it takes time for searching any website for a recipe or
watching 10-20mins video, where chatbots makes everything easier it will answer for any given Query within the seconds. This chatbot is specifically designed for
getting the recipe of a dish, After all it's a simple way to receive step by step instructions to put together in your favorite meal. For chatbot we used an
**advanced vector space model** with some **python learning libraries like nltk** and we talked more about libraries and modules in the method section and the
chatbot interaction with users and asked for a dish to find out its recipe and chatbot provided a recipe of the particular dish.

For image detection we used **TensorFlow,Keras,IBM Watson virtual recognition model** we trained some classes of local food dishes on that basis our model,
classify them and when any image come with the help of **opencv** we resize them to optimize processing time as I mentioned we talked more about **IBM Watson**,
opencv and other libraries in a method section.
